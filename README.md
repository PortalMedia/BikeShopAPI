# Bike Shop API

This project contains part of a simple .NET application for a Bike Shop.

The project has a handful of initial tests, three of which are failing due to bugs in the code. 

The test spec is correct, but we need to fix the bugs!

As an interview challenge, we'd like to pair and get the failing tests to pass.

## Getting Started
  *  Build the project using `dotnet build`
  *  Run the tests using `dotnet test`

## Failing Tests

You should find that the project builds, but contains 3 failing tests.

The goal is to pair program with an interviewee and make the 3 failing tests pass.
